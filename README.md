# Veda: The Ultimate Proactive AI HUD

Veda is an advanced, Jarvis/Friday-inspired AI assistant for Windows 11. This edition introduces **Real-Time Context Awareness** and **System Productivity Modes**, making her more proactive while keeping your privacy secured.

## 🚀 Proactive Intelligence

### 👁️ Real-Time Context
- **Environmental Awareness**: Veda monitors your active application to provide proactive help. If you're coding, she can suggest documentation; if you're writing, she can offer research tips.
- **Privacy Shield**: Veda automatically engages a "Data Shield" when you use sensitive applications (banking, password managers, private windows). She ignores all context from these sources to keep your data safe.

### ⚙️ System Productivity Modes
- **Focus Mode**: Optimizes your environment for deep work by lowering volume, adjusting brightness, and focusing on contextual assistance.
- **Stealth Mode**: Veda enters the shadows. HUD transparency is increased, voice is muted, and context tracking is disabled for maximum privacy.
- **Normal Mode**: Standard JARVIS-level protocols.

Veda's proactive features are built with multiple security layers. Sensitive apps are blacklisted by default, context monitoring is entirely local, and you have a manual kill-switch (Real-Time Context toggle) directly on the HUD.
