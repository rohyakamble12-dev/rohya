# Veda: The Absolute Ultimate AI Partner

Veda is no longer just an assistant; she is a **Digital Partner**. This **Partner Edition** introduces macro automation, emotional HUD intelligence, web ingestion, and full lifecycle task management.

## 🌟 Absolute Ultimate Upgrades

### 🤖 Veda Automation (The Macro Brain)
- **Action Learning**: Veda can now "watch" your repetitive tasks. Record a sequence of keyboard and mouse actions and ask her to replay them at any time.
- **JARVIS Macros**: Automate complex workflows by teaching Veda exactly how you work.

### 🎭 Emotion HUD Intelligence
- **Dynamic Personality**: Veda's HUD now has visual "feelings." The accent color shifts dynamically based on her current state:
    - **Calm Blue**: Standard operation.
    - **Alert Red**: System warnings or urgent tasks.
    - **Success Green**: Task completion and success.
    - **Focus Yellow**: Focus and Pomodoro sessions active.
    - **Stealth Grey**: Stealth and privacy modes.

### 📜 Custom Protocols (User Macros)
- **Command Chaining**: Define your own complex protocols. "When I say 'Start Work', open Chrome, set volume to 20%, and start a 25-minute Pomodoro."
- **Persistent Logic**: Your custom protocols are saved in her long-term memory for permanent use.

### 🌐 Web Ingestion & Analysis
- **Direct Web Reading**: Provide Veda with any URL, and she will scrape, summarize, and remember the key information from that page.
- **Enhanced Research**: Beyond Wikipedia, she can now learn from specific web articles and documentation.

### 📋 Veda Task Master
- **Life Management**: An integrated Todo system and Pomodoro timer help you stay productive throughout your day.
- **Native Notifications**: Task reminders and Pomodoro alerts are delivered via the Windows 11 Notification Center.

## 🔊 Troubleshooting Sound
If Veda is not speaking, try the following:
1.  **Run Sound Test**: Type or say "test sound" in the HUD. She will attempt to play both online and offline voices.
2.  **Check Volume**: Ensure your system volume is up and Veda isn't in **Stealth Mode** (which mutes her).
3.  **Check Internet**: Edge TTS requires an active connection. If offline, she should automatically use the local Windows voice.
4.  **Log File**: Check `veda.log` in the project root for detailed error reports.

## 🛡️ Security & Partner Ethics
The Partner Edition maintains Veda's core security philosophy. Macro data and web ingestion content remain local. Automation requires explicit user triggers, ensuring you remain in control of your system.
