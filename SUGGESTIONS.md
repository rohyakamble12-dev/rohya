# Veda: Future Expansion Protocols (Project Extremis)

To reach the full potential of a Stark-level AI assistant, the following advanced features are suggested for future development:

## 1. Multi-Modal Vision Integration
*   **Current State:** Basic face detection and active window tracking.
*   **Future:** Upgrade to `llama-3.2-11b-vision` (when hardware allows) to provide detailed descriptions of the camera feed, recognize specific objects, and read physical documents via webcam.

## 2. Autonomous Agentic Workflows
*   **Feature:** Implement a task-planning loop where Veda can break down complex requests into sub-tasks and execute them sequentially (e.g., "Research the latest NVIDIA GPUs, find the best price, and create a comparison spreadsheet").

## 3. Emotional Intelligence Matrix
*   **Feature:** Integrate voice tone analysis and facial expression recognition to detect user stress or fatigue. Veda could then automatically suggest breaks, play calming music, or adjust her wit level.

## 4. Veda Companion (Mobile App)
*   **Feature:** A Flutter or React Native app that allows the user to interact with the same Veda instance (and shared memory) while away from the Windows 11 workstation.

## 5. Advanced AR/VR HUD
*   **Feature:** Integration with Windows Mixed Reality or Meta Quest Link to project Veda's HUD elements into a 3D space around the user's desk.

## 6. Deep System Kernel Integration
*   **Feature:** Moving beyond user-level Python scripts to low-level Windows API hooks for real-time memory optimization, registry cleaning, and advanced hardware overclocking control.

## 7. Federated Learning / Private Sync
*   **Feature:** Allow multiple Veda instances (e.g., Home PC and Work Laptop) to sync their "Long-term Memory" securely using end-to-end encryption without relying on a central cloud provider.

## 8. Voice Cloning (Personalized Personas)
*   **Feature:** Allow the user to "clone" specific voices for JARVIS/FRIDAY using local training (RVC - Retrieval-based Voice Conversion) for even more immersion.
